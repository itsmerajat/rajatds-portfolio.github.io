## Work Experience
**AI Developer @ SAP Labs (_Sept 2021 - Present_)**
- •	Explainability System for Asset Depreciation: Designed an LLM-based model to explain asset depreciation throughout its life cycle using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Also, tried fine-tuning the LLaMA Large Language Model to provide relevant explanations, leading to a reduction in support incidents. 
  o	Technologies used: RAG, Python, LLaMA LLM, Hugging Face, SAP BTP. 
- •	IncidentFlow: Designed and implemented a machine learning-based system to enhance customer support workflows by providing real-time assistance to agents and optimizing resource allocation. Leveraged NLP for contextual query analysis and a recommendation engine to suggest relevant knowledge base articles, resulting in a 15-20% reduction in average handling time (AHT) and a 10-15% improvement in first-contact resolution (FCR). Integrated predictive analytics to optimize staffing, improving resource utilization by 25% and achieving cost savings, while boosting customer satisfaction.
  o	Technologies used: Time Series Forecasting, GPT, RAG, Python, TensorFlow, GenAI, SAP BTP
- •	iSprinter – Departmental Efficiency Prediction Application: Created an AI-powered application that predicts departmental effort efficiency, optimizes resource allocation, and reduces project delays. This system minimized delays in key projects, improving team performance and resource optimization. 
  o	Technologies used: Python, Predictive Modelling, Regression, Pandas, Java, JavaScript, Flask, Docker, SAP BTP.
- •	Mentorship & Leadership: I have been a scrum master for more than a year and Mentored and trained 3 junior developers and 2 junior data scientists, guiding them through technical problem-solving, coding best practices, and project delivery.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.



### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models that estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
